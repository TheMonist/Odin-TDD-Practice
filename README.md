# Odin-TDD-Practice

The purpose of this exercise is to practice using unit testing and test-driven development(TDD). Unit testing is a method by which software behavior is examined before going into production. These tests provide strict goals that a piece of code must satisfy.

Test-driven is the practice of writing tests before actually writing code. The benefits of TDD encouraging refactoring, improving design, eliminating waste, and forcing developers/engineers to slow down and think prior to writing code and putting it into production. What this means is that there should be less bugs and higher quality software.

## Functions

The following functions are being tested for correct functionality and implementation:

1. `capitalize` takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
2. `reverseString` takes a string and returns it reversed.
3. `calculator` contains the basic operations of `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` which takes in two numbers and returns the correct calculation.
4. `caesarCipher` takes a string and a shift factor(key) and returns it with each character "shifted" in relation to the key.
5. `analyzeArray` takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the properties of `average`, `min`, `max`, and `length`.
